Preface
=======

This document contains our training material for the CASE tools. We have devoted
a chapter to each of the tools: VERDICT, DCRYPPS, GearCASE, HAMR, and Resolute.
In each case, we begin by describing the tool---what it does, and why you would
want to use it---then walk the user through the process of applying it to an
example model.

Our goals for each chapter are twofold: First we want to get users up and
running with the given tool on their own model as swiftly as possible. This
motivated our choice to structure each chapter as a step-by-step example, so
users can follow along with applying the tool to their own models. Second,
we want to highlight all the main features and advantages of the tool and help
users understand how and why it could be useful. We achieved this by getting
feedback on each chapter from the tool developers, to ensure we capture their
vision of when and how the tool should be most effectively used.

A key observation we made when we began writing these chapters is that using
each tool involves a development cycle:

1. Develop an initial system model.
2. Apply whatever tool-specific annotations given tool requires.
3. Run the tool.
4. Interpret the results and react to them by evolving the model and/or system
   design.
5. Return to step 2 and repeat as necessary.

Therefore, we have structured each example so as to walk users through the steps
of this process. We believe this will enable users to apply the same process to
their own models by example.

This document assumes a baseline of knowledge about AADL and AGREE, and that the
user has an AADL model of their system to apply the tools to. These
prerequisites are covered by our general AADL training material in "So You Want
to AADL". Together, we believe these documents will ease the process of getting
started with the DARPA CASE tooling.
